### User Design

### Code Maintainability

### General Release-Readiness
For the most part we would classify this software as complete enough to be released. While there are some features that would benefit the software significantly (e.g. better error messages, GUI, few memory bugs), the software as it stands is totally usable and for the most part bug free. We would recommend some corrective and preventitive corrections via patching after release in order to fix the memory bugs and add features to better aid the users in quickly learning how to use the software as we found one of the biggest issues to be the efficiency in which users come to learn the program.
